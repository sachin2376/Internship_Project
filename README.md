# Internship_Project
The project is simple - Hospital management system. Looks simple but through which I learn some important concepts like- Microservices,Rest APIs, Swagger API, JWT authentications etc !!!


3 Microservices : IpTreatment , IpTreatmentOffering, Insurer
1 Microservice - For JWT Authentication 
1 MVC Portal - using asp.net MVC


I have used JWT middleware to authenticate each microservice seperately. //{ Helpers Folder }
